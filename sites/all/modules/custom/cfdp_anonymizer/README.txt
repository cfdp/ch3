CfDP Anonymizer
===============

The goal of this module is to protect the anonymity of the anonymous users of
forums, Q and As, subscription services and so on.

It does so by trying to hide all personal information like email addresses from
the UI of Drupal so no one can access them.

Currently anonymizin:

- Subscriptions page of Node Notify
- Author email field on edit comment page
